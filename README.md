# Tennis Tournament Scheduling Application
The purpose of this application was to demonstrate our knowledge of a relational database and SQL in which our group chose MySQL as the language.
With previous experience doing front end with Flask in Python from my PetSitter project, I encouraged the group to use these tools to create our appication.
Boostrap was used to quickly create a smooth modern theme for our application to focus our resources on the functionality of the application with some 
minimal CSS customizations. Jinja templating was used in this project to reduce redundant copy and paste code by having a main template in the index.html
file that created the basis for the other files. Jinja also provided excellent functionality by incorporating Python into our html files to use as
functionality by using if statements and for loops to determine what information was printed on the screen via data gathered by the database. Javascript was
also used to connect the Boostrap theme as well as make our PUT functionality to update entries in the database.
